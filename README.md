ATMFrontAndBackEnd
==================

<h1>ATM Project for Quality Assurance Course</h1>

<hr />

This project was done for a course where we were utilizing eXtreme Programming with a partner.

The purpose of this project was to create an ATM front-end and ATM back-end.

This code would work as follows:

- User can login as a Agent or Retail
- User can deposit, withdraw or transfer as retail or deposit, withdraw, transfer, create account and delete account as a agent.
- The transactions would make it's way into a transaction summary file that would be merged with others.
- The transactions would then be taken in as a text file in the back end.  This would alter the master accounts file that the front end would take in to see current accounts and their respective balances.
